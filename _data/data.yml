          First, I had started learning fundementals of Electric Circuts under supervising of
          <a target="_blank" href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hossein-Behfar'>Dr. Hossein Behfar</a>.
          After several month, due to exiting of my co-workers, I decided to involve to another group.
          Shortly, I started working with <a target="_blank" href='http://infoag.ir/en/'>Precision Agriculture group</a>
          which I'm proud of it. (details in experience section below)
          
          A great course that I had was Maintenance Engineering, taught by
          <a target="_blank" href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hamid-Ghassemzadeh'>Prof. Hamid Reza Ghassemzadeh</a>.
          If I want to name a course which I understood what is engineering (and also Biosystems), that's it.
            
          Highlighted courses which I'd like to share:
            - Computer Programming (C programming language)
            - Mechanical Engineering Design
            - Maintenance Engineering
            - Measuring and Control tools

            Machine learning course taught by Prof. Andrew Ng, Associate professor
            at Stanford University.

            I believe learning basics is the most important point of acquiring knowledge.
            This course tought me perfect ML basics alongside whatever I learnt from AI course
            by <a target="_blank" href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmoud-omid-4057b015a/'>Dr. Mahmoud Omid</a> in Univesity of Tehran.
            There is a <a target="_blank" href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU'>free Standford course in Youtube</a> as well
            which is close to Coursera course but Youtube course is a little harder and goes deeper in Mathematical details.
