            I believe learning basics is the most important point of acquiring knowledge.
            This course tought me perfect ML basics alongside whatever I learnt from AI course
            by <a target="_blank" href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmoud-omid-4057b015a/'>Dr. Mahmoud Omid</a> in Univesity of Tehran.

      - title: PVC Duct Cutting Machine Computer Vision System
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: |
            This project used computer vision technology to identify clipping points within PVC ducts,
            focusing on detecting their flat areas for accurate cuts. Adaptable to ambient noise,
            the system ensured consistent performance,
            while its lightweight design enabled seamless integration with the machine's high-speed operations.
            Utilizing a Raspberry Pi, this compact yet powerful computing platform was used to drive the entire system.

      - title: Remote Controller for a Silage Block Cutting Machine
        link: "#"
        tagline: |
            Due to operator injuries, while cutting stacked up silage blocks,
            a remote controlling system was developed and configured
            so that the operators be able to control the machine using wireless technology.
            The device was able to fully control the machine. The developed device controlled the system
            by manipulating the pneumatic and hydraulic valves of the machine using a TCP/UDP local network with an android application.
            Which in fact, the machine performs with more precision and offers product and safety measures.

            There are a large number of small agriculture farms around mid-to-big cities in Iran which
            they plant different basils alongside eachother in several section in their farms.
            This project aimed this businesses to help them increasing outcome and decreasing wastes.
            This machine was design by intelligence functionality in mind and using previous works and experiences.
